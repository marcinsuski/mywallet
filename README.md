# Welcome to MyWallet!


## 💡 Concept
A web application allowing to track user's budget by adding income and expenses.
 
## 🔍 Project overview 
The app now stores data in localstorage but it is possible to add a database in the backend.
User can add income and/or expenses from a list of provided categories. Both income and expenses are set to localStorage. Data is added for a given month and it is possible to select the month to see the balance and all transactions for the specified time.

 
## 📦 Tech stack:
- React
- MUI + CSS Modules
- Chart.JS
 
## ⚙ TODO
- refactor code, possibly add Redux as a single store to manage all states,
- add a tab to see all the data together,
- add a calendar and more options to see, e.g. whole year or different timespans,
